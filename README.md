Car Fuel Consumption Analyzer
Introduction
The Car Fuel Consumption Analyzer is an app designed to assist car buyers in making informed decisions about their next vehicle purchase. The app provides an in-depth analysis of fuel consumption data and allows users to compare different car types. By offering clear insights into fuel efficiency and carbon emissions, the app helps users narrow down their options and choose a vehicle that meets their needs and aligns with their environmental goals.

What is the problem you want to solve?
Car buyers often face challenges when it comes to understanding the fuel efficiency and environmental impact of different vehicles. This app aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly interface that allows for easy comparison of various car models based on their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The app helps users make well-informed decisions that balance performance, cost, and environmental considerations.

Data/Operation Abstraction Design
The app leverages a dataset that includes detailed information about various car models, including:

Year, make, and model
Vehicle class and engine size
Transmission type
Fuel type and fuel consumption
CO2 emissions
The data is cleaned and pre-processed to ensure accuracy and consistency. The app provides users with interactive tools to explore and compare fuel consumption and CO2 emissions across different car models. Users can filter the data based on specific criteria, such as fuel type, vehicle class, and engine size, to gain insights into the performance and environmental impact of their chosen models.

Future Work
In order to continuously improve the app and enhance user experience, we plan to undertake the following future work:

Enhanced Data Coverage: Expand the dataset to include more car models, makes, and years to provide a comprehensive comparison of different vehicles.
User Customization: Enable users to save their preferences and search history to provide personalized recommendations based on their past choices.
Real-time Updates: Integrate real-time data updates to provide users with the latest information on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for the most recent car models.
Mobile Application: Develop a mobile version of the app to make it more accessible and convenient for users on the go.
User Feedback and Suggestions: Collect user feedback and suggestions to identify areas for improvement and new features that users would find valuable.
